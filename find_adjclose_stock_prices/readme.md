# Find Adjusted Close Stock Prices

I wrote this script while I was taking part in a 'Machine Learning for Trading' course. It simply gets data from csv files, inserts this into a data frame, and plots this data to a line chart. You could alter the stocks used by changing the list of symbols aptly named 'Symbols'. You can download the csvs from Yahoo Finance, they have a very easy to use download option on the historical tab found on all stocks.
